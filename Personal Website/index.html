    <h2>STATUS POST 12/12/2021</h2>
    <p>This is a post regarding float.
    <br> 
    Float doesn't work.
    <br>
	I've tried, and tried, and tried, and tried. Whenever I zoom the page in and out, it breaks.
    <br>
	I'll try again later. Until then...

    <h2>STATUS POST 12/11/2021</h2>
    <p>Following up on the last post... have you ever wondered what things will be like in a year?
    <br> 
    It's such a useless thing to think about! You can never really know, so why even wonder?
    <br>
	Though, stranger still, is thinking that, maybe, you from one year in the future may remember this exact day.
    <br>
	Could you then say that the future you is spying on the current you?
	<br>
	I've thought about that once while driving home one day. I remembered an exact moment that happened a few weeks prior.
	<br>
	Back then, I had no idea that I would think back to then.
	<br>
	In that moment, I simply stopped and said "Hi!" to my future self.</p>

    <h2>STATUS POST 12/10/2021</h2>
    <p>Do you ever stop to remember exactly what happened a year ago from today? 
    <br> 
    I find it really interesting sometimes to go through old photos and find whatever pictures, videos, or screenshots I took on that particular date in time.
    <br>
	Sometimes, I like what I find. Other times, not so much...
    <br>
	But that doesn't mean it's not fun!
	<br>
	It's good to remember things you enjoyed. And if you don't like what you see, that's a reminder that you're a better you today!
	<br>
	And I find that comforting, in a way.
	<br>
	Indeed; we are not the same person from day to day. How could we expect to be the same we were one year ago?
	<br>
	<br>
	That's my thought for today. I'll post something else tomorrow (if I remember!)
